                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm a passionate and self-taught programmer, now a Master's student 
                            in Media Computer Science at the University of Vienna. My journey into 
                            programming began long before my formal education, driven by curiosity 
                            and a deep interest in creating, learning, and solving real-world problems 
                            through code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my Bachelor's, I explored a wide range of programming areas, with 
                            a special focus on media computer science. I took courses on platforms like edX and 
                            Udemy, expanding my knowledge beyond the classroom. My Bachelor's thesis was a 
                            deep dive into image generation and classification using Unity and TensorFlow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During one summer, I had the opportunity to intern at Partium, where I worked 
                            as part of their R&D team. There, I applied the skills from my thesis, focusing 
                            on software engineering for innovative solutions. This experience led to an 
                            offer for a junior position, which I accepted. Simultaneously, I began my 
                            Master's, further honing my skills in game development, digital media, and 
                            computer graphics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I'm working on my Master's thesis, which involves building a 
                            procedural planet generation system and LOD (Level of Detail) algorithm 
                            to enable realistic and immersive world exploration. This project reflects 
                            my core passion for game development and computer graphics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond academics, I love learning new things—whether it's building my own 
                            game engine, creating small tools to automate tasks, or experimenting with 
                            different data-driven projects. I'm also deeply involved in game modding, 
                            working on a Super Mario 64 ROM hack to push my creativity and technical skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of everything I do is a drive to learn and create. Whether it's 
                            developing a new skill, exploring a new technology, or diving into a complex 
                            problem, I always aim to stay curious and push the boundaries of what's possible.
                        </p>
