                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm a passionate and self-taught programmer and currently Master student 
                            in Media Computer Science at the University of Vienna. My journey into 
                            programming began long before my formal education, driven by curiosity 
                            and a deep interest in creating, learning, and solving real-world problems 
                            through code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During my Bachelor, I explored a wide range of programming areas, with 
                            a special focus on media computer science. I took courses on platforms like edX and 
                            Udemy, expanding my knowledge beyond the classroom. My Bachelor's thesis was a 
                            deep dive into image generation and classification using Unity and TensorFlow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During summer 2022, I had the opportunity to intern at Partium, where I worked 
                            as part of their R&D team. There, I applied the skills from my thesis and university
                            overall, focusing on software engineering for innovative solutions. This experience 
                            led to an offer for a junior position, which I accepted. Simultaneously, I began my 
                            Master, further improving my skills in game development, computer vision, and 
                            computer graphics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I'm working on my Master's thesis, which involves building a 
                            procedural planet generation system and LOD (Level of Detail) algorithm 
                            to enable realistic and immersive world exploration. This project reflects 
                            my core passion for game development and computer graphics. Additionally, 
                            I am currently transforming my thesis into a paper for the International 
                            Conference on Entertainment Computing and was able to present my work 
                            to other people. This experience intensified my passion for research 
                            and its potential impact.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond academics, I love learning new things—whether it's building my own 
                            game engine, creating small tools to automate tasks, or solving different 
                            computer vision tasks. I'm also deeply involved in game modding, working
                            on a Super Mario 64 ROM hack to push my creativity and technical skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of everything I do is a drive to learn and create. Whether it's 
                            developing a new skill, exploring a new technology, or diving into a complex 
                            problem, I always aim to stay curious and push the boundaries of what's possible.
