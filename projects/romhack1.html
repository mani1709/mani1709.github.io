                    Developed for the SimpleFlips' Slide Hack Competition (2024), this ROM hack draws inspiration 
                    from Super Mario Galaxy's Tall Trunk Galaxy, hence the name Tall Trunk Galaxy 64. It was developed 
                    in around 20 days, during which I delved into the C source code of the original game and used 
                    Blender for 3D modeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hack features a main hub with some hidden secrets and a main level focused on a slide, reminiscent 
                    of Tall Trunk Galaxy's iconic slide. The level includes two stars: one for completing the slide and 
                    another for collecting the 8 red coins, strategically placed to add an extra challenge for players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the development, I applied various game design techniques I’ve learned over the years, 
                    focusing on creating engaging gameplay while maintaining a balance between challenge and fun. 
                    The project was a fantastic learning experience that pushed my skills in level design and game development.
