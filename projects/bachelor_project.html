                    This project was part of my Bachelor's thesis, where I worked on hand detection and gesture recognition using TensorFlow in Python. The project was split into two main tasks: image generation and training/testing the machine learning model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the image generation task, I used Unity to generate numerous images of a 3D hand model in different positions and lighting conditions. The purpose was to provide a diverse dataset for the model to learn from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second task involved training the machine learning model. The model was trained on two types of tasks: binary classification (hand present or not) and gesture detection. For binary classification, I generated images where the hand was either present or absent. For gesture detection, I selected distinct hand gestures and trained the model to classify them correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results were promising. The binary task consistently returned accurate results, and the gesture detection model worked well in most cases when tested with real-life data.
