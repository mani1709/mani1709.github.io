                    This project is based on my coursework focused on building a game engine and sending data for cloud gaming purposes. 
                    The goal was to create my own engine using Vulkan. The project consists of several components, including a 
                    comprehensive game design document and two projects: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first project is a receiver that uses FFmpeg to decode the data and generate a video on a screen. 
                    The second project is a simple racing game where you compete against an AI to see who can finish faster. 
                    For this, I employed NVIDIA's PhysX as the physics library and used FFmpeg to encode the data needed for transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The racing game showcases the capabilities of the engine and provides a fun, competitive experience. 
                    If you're interested in seeing the racing game I developed, I would be happy to share it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, my experience with this project has inspired me to explore further enhancements in a new game engine, 
                    where I aim to implement various lighting effects and features to deepen my understanding of game design.
