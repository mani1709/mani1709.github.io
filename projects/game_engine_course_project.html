                    This project is based on my coursework focused on building a game engine and sending data for cloud gaming purposes. 
                    The goal was to create my own engine using Vulkan. The project consists of several components, including a 
                    comprehensive game design document and two projects: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first project is a receiver that uses FFmpeg to decode the data and generate a video on a screen. 
                    The second project is a simple racing game where you compete against an AI to see who can finish faster. 
                    For this, I employed NVIDIA's PhysX as the physics library and used FFmpeg to encode the data needed for transmission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My interest in this topic has motivated me to build a new game engine from the ground up, where I aim to implement 
                    interesting features like various lighting effects and more in order to understand them better. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, there are no visuals or code available for this project, but if there is interest in seeing the 
                    racing game I developed, I would be happy to show it.
