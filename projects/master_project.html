                    The Procedural Planet Generator is designed to create realistic and immersive planets using 
                    advanced algorithms and randomization techniques. This project aims to enhance the experience of 
                    exploration in virtual environments by generating unique planets each time.

                    Currently being developed with Godot, GLSL, and Blender, 
                    this generator focuses on achieving a balance between performance and visual fidelity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project is still ongoing, and therefore this page will be updated as soon as the project has been finished.
